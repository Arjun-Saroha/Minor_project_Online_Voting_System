# Minor_Project_Online_Voting_System


INTRODUCTION

Existing Voting System:

•	Large space and manpower are required to setup voting booths in multiple areas around city or village.

•	High security has to be maintained on the date of election.

•	Voter must visit the place where voting booth is arranged.

•	Sometimes, voter needs to stand in a queue for a long time.

•	Again, manpower is required for volunteering and assistant of voters at the place of voting.

•	Voting process is done manually on voting machine.

•	Vote counting is done with the manual process.

•	Then there is a gap of few days for results to be displayed.

•	So, if we see, here in traditional voting system, we need lot of manpower, energy, and time to conduct this process.
